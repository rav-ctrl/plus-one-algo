# Plus One Algorithm Solution

This repository contains a solution to the algorithm challenge where the goal is to increment a large integer, represented by an array of its digits, by one. The digits in the array are in left-to-right order, from most significant to least significant, with no leading zeros.

The solution efficiently handles the carry that results from adding one to the integer, ensuring correct results even when the increment leads to an increase in the number of digits (e.g., from 999 to 1000).

### Examples

- **Example 1:**  
  **Input:** `[1,2,3]`  
  **Output:** `[1,2,4]`  
  **Explanation:** Represents the integer 123. Incrementing by one gives 124.

- **Example 2:**  
  **Input:** `[4,3,2,1]`  
  **Output:** `[4,3,2,2]`  
  **Explanation:** Represents the integer 4321. Incrementing by one gives 4322.

- **Example 3:**  
  **Input:** `[9]`  
  **Output:** `[1,0]`  
  **Explanation:** Represents the integer 9. Incrementing by one gives 10.
